Welcome to My Vivino

# Task
Data collecting and Building wine recommendation system

# Description
Our goal is not only make our customers happy, but do some analysis. Unfortunately, we don’t have the data we need, so let’s get it. Where to find the data? Any where. Scrap Vivino / Bevmo / Delectable / Wine-Searcher /
I have chose www.wine.com

# Installation
Please download http key to download this project, install all required libraries and run.

# Usage
To build recommendation system I have used from feature_extraction.text TfidfVectorizer and from metrics.pairwise cosine_similarity of Scikit-Learn library.

In this Recommendation system you will enter name or type wine in which you are interested and this system will open top 10 most popular wines in wine.com and will open their web pages separately.
